###Requirements :
For this coursework, you are asked to develop a website similar to www.reddit.com. Reddit is a news
aggregator – that is, you can submit links to webpages together with a short description, and the
community of users (yourself and other users) can post comments on the links, as well as upvote or
downvote them. In preparation for this coursework, you are advised to visit Reddit and browse through
the site, making a note of its features.
You are not asked to develop a fully-fledged version of Reddit. Instead, your version should have the
following minimum set of features:
1. A page showing a single list of links submitted by users
2. A page where all comments about a link can be seen (as a single list) and new comments
submitted
3. A means of upvoting or downvoting links
Logins and registrations are not required for this coursework – hence when links and comments are
submitted, the application should also ask for the user’s name.
Extra marks are available if the following features are added:
4. Pagination of links – i.e, links are not shown all on one page, but might be shown 20 links at a
time (clicking on ‘Next Page’ then shows the next 20 links)
5. Sorting of links – by votes or date submitted
6. Threading of comments (as done on reddit)
For this coursework, the following is required:
- a survey of similar existing sites, comparing and contrasting their features
- a discussion of the requirements for your site (these are given briefly above but need fleshing out)
- data requirements (discussion and diagram showing tables etc.) – describe the database you need
for this application.
- site design - what screens will the user see when they interact with the site (these should be mockups
or wireframes) and how will they navigate between the different screens (see lecture 3 for examples).
- an implementation using CodeIgniter (version 3.x should be used), deployed on the university server
(not on your laptop or own PC). Your implementation should not use jQuery and ajax as we will be
covering this in Coursework 2 when we extend the MCQ web application. If you do use Ajax and jQuery,
no extra marks will be awarded. Class diagrams (see lectures 2 and 3 for examples) to show the
structure of your application should be included as well as code
